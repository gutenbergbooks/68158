<p class="drop-cap">“I HATE him!”</p>

<p>Thus, in a loud, angry voice, spoke
a lad named Charles Freeman. His
face was red, and his fair white brow
disfigured by passion.</p>

<p>“Yes, I hate him! and he had better keep
his distance from me, or I—”</p>

<p>“What would you do, Charles?” asked the
lad’s companion, seeing that he paused.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what I might not be tempted
to do. I would trample upon him as I would
upon a snake.”</p>

<p>For a boy fourteen years of age, this was
a dreadful state of mind to be in. The individual
who had offended him was a fellow-student,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
named William Aiken. The cause of
offence we will relate.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Charles Freeman was a self-willed, passionate
boy, who hesitated not to break any rule of
the institution at which he was receiving his
education, provided, in doing so, he felt quite
sure of not being found out and punished. On
a certain occasion, he, with two or three others,
who were planning some act of insubordination,
called into the room of William Aiken and
asked him to join them.</p>

<p>“It will be such grand sport,” said Freeman.</p>

<p>“But will it be right?” asked the more
conscientious lad.</p>

<p>“Right or wrong, we are going to do it.
Who cares for the president and all the faculty
put together? They are a set of hypocrites
and oppressors: make the best you can of
them.”</p>

<p>“They don’t ask us to do anything but
what is required by the rules of the institution;
and then, I think, we ought to obey.”</p>

<p>“You are wonderfully inclined to obedience!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
said Charles Freeman, in a sneering voice.
“Come, boys! We have mistaken Master
Aiken. I did not know before that he was
such a milksop. Come!”</p>

<p>The other lads retired with Freeman, but
they did not insult Aiken, for they knew him
to be kind-hearted and honourable, and felt
more disposed to respect him for his objections
than to speak harshly to him for entertaining
them. Aiken made no reply to the insulting
language of the hot-headed, thoughtless Charles
Freeman, although his words roused within
him an instant feeling of indignation, that
almost forced his tongue to utter some strong,
retaliating expressions. But he controlled himself,
and was very glad, as soon as his visitors
had left him, that he had been able to do so.</p>

<p>On the next morning, before daylight, some
persons, unknown to the faculty, brought from
a neighbouring field a spiteful ram, and tied
him, with a strong cord, to a post near the
door of the president’s dwelling. The president,
who was very near-sighted, always read
prayers in the chapel at five o’clock in the
morning. At the usual hour he descended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
from his chamber, and came out at his front
door to go to the chapel, which was distant
some fifty yards. It was a little after break
of day. In the dim morning twilight, the
president could see but indistinctly even objects
that were very near to him.</p>

<p>The ram, which had, after his fierce struggles
with those who had reduced him to a state of
captivity, lain down quietly, roused himself up
at the sound of the opening door, and stood
ready to give the president a rather warm reception
the moment he came within reach of
him. Unconscious of the danger that menaced
him, the president descended from the door
with slow and cautious steps, and received in
his side a terrible blow from the animal’s head,
that threw him, some feet from where he was
standing, prostrate upon the ground. Fortunately
the ram had reached within a few
inches of the length of his tether when the
blow was given, and could not, therefore, repeat
it, as the object of his wrath was beyond his
reach.</p>

<p>The president was rather severely hurt; so
much so that he was unable to go to the chapel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
and read morning prayers, and was confined to
his chamber for some days. No investigation
into the matter was made until after he was
able to be about again. Then he assembled all
the students together and stated to them what
had occurred, and the pain he had endured in
consequence, and asked to have the individuals
who had been guilty of this outrage designated.
All were silent. One student looked at another,
and then at the assembled faculty, but no one
gave the desired information, although many of
those present knew the parties who were engaged
in the act. Finding that no one would
divulge the names of those who had been guilty
of the outrage against him, the president said,—</p>

<p>“Let all who know nothing of this matter
rise to their feet.”</p>

<p>Charles Freeman was the first to spring up,
and one after another followed him, until all
had risen except William Aiken. The president
paused for some moments, and then ordered
the young men to take their seats.</p>

<p>“William Aiken will please to come forward,”
said the president. As the lad rose from his
seat, several of the faculty, who had their eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
upon Freeman, and who had reason for suspecting
that he knew about as much of the matter
as any one, noticed that he cast a look of anger
towards Aiken.</p>

<p>“It seems, then, that you know something
about this matter,” said the president.</p>

<p>“All I know about it,” replied Aiken, “is,
that I was applied to by some of my fellow-students
to join them in doing what has been
done, and that I declined participating in it.”</p>

<p>“For what reason, sir?”</p>

<p>“Because I thought it wrong.”</p>

<p>“Who were the students that applied to
you?”</p>

<p>“I would rather not answer that question,
sir.”</p>

<p>“But I insist upon it.”</p>

<p>“Then I must decline doing so.”</p>

<p>“You will be suspended, sir.”</p>

<p>“I should regret that,” was the lad’s manly
reply. “But as I have broken no rule of the
institution, such a suspension would be no disgrace
to me.”</p>

<p>The president was perplexed. At this point
one of the professors whispered something in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
his ear, and his eye turned immediately upon
Freeman.</p>

<p>“Let Charles Freeman come forward,” he
said.</p>

<p>With a fluctuating countenance the guilty
youth left his seat and approached the faculty.</p>

<p>“Is this one of them?” said the president.</p>

<p>Aiken made no reply.</p>

<p>“Silence is assent,” the president remarked;
“you can take your seat, young man.”</p>

<p>As Aiken moved away, the president, who
had rather unjustly fixed upon him the burden
of having given information, tacitly, against
Freeman, said, addressing the latter:—</p>

<p>“And now, sir, who were your associates in
this thing?”</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> am no common informer, sir. You had
better ask William Aiken. No doubt <i>he</i> will
tell you,” replied the lad.</p>

<p>The president stood thoughtful for a moment,
and then said,—</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, you can all retire.”</p>

<p>It was as the students were retiring from
the room where this proceeding had been conducted
that Freeman made the bitter remarks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
about Aiken with which our story opens. It
happened that the subject of them was so close
to him as to hear all he said. About ten
minutes after this, against the persuasion of a
fellow-student, Freeman went to the room of
Aiken for the satisfaction of telling him, as he
said, “a piece of his mind.” Aiken was sitting
by a table, with his head resting upon his
hand, as Freeman came in. He looked up,
when his door opened, and, seeing who it was,
rose quickly to his feet, and advanced towards
him a few steps, saying, with a smile, as he
did so:—</p>

<p>“I am glad you have come, Charles. I had
just made up my mind to go to your room. Sit
down now, and let us talk this matter over with
as little hard feelings as possible. I am sure it
need not make us enemies. If I have been at
any point in the least to blame, I will freely
acknowledge it, and do all in my power to repair
any injury that I may have done to you.
Can I do more?”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” replied Charles, completely
subdued by the unexpected manner and words
of Aiken.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>“I heard you say, a little while ago, that
you hated me,” resumed William. “Of course
there must be some cause for this feeling. Tell
me what it is, Charles.”</p>

<p>The kind manner in which Aiken spoke, and
the mildness of his voice, completely subdued
the lion in the heart of Freeman. He was
astonished at himself, and the wonderful revulsion
that had taken place, so suddenly, in his
feelings.</p>

<p>“I spoke hastily,” he said. “But I was blind
with anger at being discovered through you.”</p>

<p>“But I did not discover you, remember that,
Charles.”</p>

<p>“If you had risen with the rest—”</p>

<p>“I would not, in word or act, tell a lie,
Charles, for my right hand,” said Aiken, in an
earnest voice, interrupting him. “You must
not blame me for this.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I ought not, but—”</p>

<p>Freeman left the sentence unfinished, and rising
to his feet, commenced walking the floor of
Aiken’s room, hurriedly. This was continued
for some minutes, when he stopped suddenly,
and extending his hand, said,—</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>“I have thought it all over, William, and I
believe I have no cause of complaint against
you; but I acknowledge that you have against
me. I have insulted you and hated you without
a cause. I wish I could act, in all things,
from the high principles that govern you.”</p>

<p>“Try, Charles, try!” said Aiken with warmth,
as he grasped the hand of his fellow-student.</p>

<p>“It will be no use for me to try,” returned
Freeman, sadly. “I shall be expelled from the
institution; my father will be angry; and I
shall perhaps be driven, by my hot and hasty
spirit, to say something to him that will estrange
us, for he is a man of a stern temper.”</p>

<p>“Don’t fear such consequences,” said Aiken
kindly. “Leave it to me. I think I can make
such representations to the president as will induce
him to let the matter drop where it is.”</p>

<p>“If you can do so, it may save me from
ruin,” replied Freeman, with much feeling.</p>

<p>William Aiken was not deceived in his
expectations. He represented to the kind-hearted
but rather impetuous president the repentant
state of Freeman’s mind, and the consequences
likely to arise if he should be expelled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
from college. The president made no promises;
but nothing more was heard of the subject.
From that time the two students were warm
friends; and Freeman was not only led to see
the beauty and excellence of truth and integrity
of character, but to act from the same high
principles that governed his noble-minded
friend.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is not one of our young readers who
cannot see what sad consequences might have
arisen, if William Aiken had not kept down his
indignant feelings, and been governed by kindness
instead of anger.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="antiqua">Ada and her Pet Fawn.</span></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/image018b.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THERE was once a dear child named
Ada, who was of so sweet a temper
that she only knew how to love; and
the consequence was, that everybody
and everything that could know her,
loved the sweet little girl in return. I do not
believe that a servant in her father’s family
ever spoke unkindly to Ada, she was so good.
There are but few of my young readers, I am
afraid, that can say so of themselves. Cook
scolds, the chambermaid is so cross, and nurse
is out of temper, whenever you come near them.
Yes, you know all that; but, my young friends,
I am afraid it is all your own fault. Now,
examine closely your own feelings and conduct,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
and see if you do not make this trouble for
yourselves. Do you always speak kindly to
those around you; and do you always try to
give them as little trouble as possible?</p>

<p>As for Ada, everybody loved her; and the
reason, as I have already stated, was plain:
she didn’t know any feeling toward others except
that of love. Even the dumb animals
would come to her side when she appeared.
The cat would rub against her, and purr as
she sat in her little chair; and when she went
out to play among the flowers, would run after
her just as you have seen a favourite dog run
after his master. She never passed Lion, the
watch-dog, that he didn’t wag his great tail, or
turn his head to look after her; and if she
stopped and spoke to or put her hand upon
him, his old limbs would quiver with delight,
and his face would actually laugh like a human
face. And why was this? It was because love
prompted Ada to kind acts towards everything.
Love beamed from her innocent countenance,
and gave a music to her voice that all ears,
even those of dumb animals, were glad to hear.
Yes, everything loved Ada, because she was good.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>The father of gentle, loving Ada was a rich
English lord—a certain class of wealthy and
distinguished men in England, as most young
readers know, are called lords—and he had a
great estate some miles from London, in which
were many animals; among them, herds of
deer. When Ada was three or four years old,
her father went to live on this estate. Around
the fine old mansion into which they removed
were stately trees, green lawns, and beautiful
gardens; and a short distance away, and concealed
from view by a thick grove, was the
park where roamed the graceful deer.</p>

<p>Under the shade of those old trees, upon the
smoothly-shaven lawn, or amid the sweet flowers
in the garden, Ada spent many hours every
day, one of the happiest of beings alive.</p>

<p>One morning—it was a few weeks after Ada
had come to live in this fair and beautiful
place—she strayed off a short distance from the
house, being lured away by the bright wild
flowers that grew thickly all around, and with
which she was filling her apron. At last, when
her tiny apron would not hold a blossom more
without pushing off some other flower, Ada<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
looked up from the ground, and discovered that
she was out of sight of her house, and among
trees which stood so thickly together that the
sky could scarcely be seen overhead, nor the
light beyond, when she endeavoured to look
between the leafy branches. But Ada did not
feel afraid, for she knew no cause for fear. She
loved everything, and she felt that everything
loved her. There was not any room in her
heart for fear.</p>

<p>Still Ada felt too much alone, and she turned
and sought to find her way out of the woods
and get back again. While yet among the
trees, she heard a noise of feet approaching;
and turning, she saw an animal that was unlike
any she had seen before. It came up close
to her, and neither of them felt afraid. It was
a fawn, only a few months old. The fawn
looked into Ada’s face with its dark bright eyes,
and when she spoke to it, and laid her hand
upon its head, the young creature pressed lovingly
against the child.</p>

<p>When Ada found her way out of the woods,
and came again upon the green lawn, the young
deer was close by her side. As soon as Lion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
saw the fawn, he gave a loud bark, and came
dashing toward the timid creature. But Ada
put her arm around its neck, and said,—</p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid. Lion won’t hurt you.
Lion is a good dog.”</p>

<p>And Lion seemed to understand the act of
Ada, for he stopped short before he reached
them, wagged his tail, and looked curiously at
the new companion which Ada had found.
First he walked round and round, as if the
whole matter was not clear to him. He had
chased deer in his time, and did not seem to
understand why he was not to sink his great
teeth into the tender flank of the gentle creature
that had followed his young mistress from
the woods. But he soon appeared to get light
on this difficult subject, for he came up to be
patted by Ada, and did not even growl at
the fawn, nor show any disposition to hurt
it.</p>

<p>The fawn would not stay in the park after
this. Ada’s father had it taken back once or
twice, but before the day was gone it managed
to escape, and came to see its newly-found
friend. After this it was permitted to remain;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
and every day little Ada fed it with her own
hand. When others of the family approached,
the timid creature would start away; but when
Ada appeared, it came with confidence to her
side.</p>

<p>Ada had a brother two years older than she
was. He was different from his sister in not
having her innocent mind and loving heart.
Sometimes he indulged in a cruel disposition,
and often he was ill-tempered. When William
saw the fawn he was delighted, and tried to
make friends with the gentle animal. But the
fawn was afraid of him, and when he tried to
come near would run away, or come up to Ada.
Then, if William put his hand on it to caress
it, the fawn would shrink closer to Ada, and
tremble. William did not like it because the
fawn would not be friends with him, and wondered
why it should be afraid of him, and not
of Ada. He did not think that it was because
Ada was so good, while he let evil tempers
come into his heart.</p>

<p>“But how could the fawn know this?” ask
my young readers. “The fawn couldn’t see
what was in William’s heart.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>No; for if it could have done so, it would
have been wiser than a human being. But all
good affections, let it be remembered, as well as
all evil affections, represent themselves in the
face, and picture themselves in the eyes; and
there is, besides, a sphere of what is good or
evil about every one, according to the heart’s
affections—just as the sphere of a rose is around
the flower in its odour, showing its quality.
Animals, as well as human beings, can read, by
a kind of instinct, the good or evil of any one
in his face, and perceive, by a mysterious sense,
the sphere of good or evil that surrounds
him.</p>

<p>You do not clearly understand this, my
young reader; nevertheless it is so. If you
are good, others will know it at a glance, and
<i>feel</i> it when you come near them. And the
same will be the case if your hearts are
evil.</p>

<p>Ada’s pet fawn stayed with her many months,
and nothing harmed it. The horns began to
push forth, like little knobs, from its head;
and afterwards it grew up to be a stately deer,
and was sent back to the park. Ada often<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
went to see her favourite, which now had a
pair of beautiful branching antlers. It always
knew her, and would come up to her side and
lick her hand when she held it forth.</p>

<p>Such power has love over even a brute
animal.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">“HERE! lend me your knife, Bill; I’ve
left mine in the house,” said Edgar
Harris to his younger brother. He
spoke in a rude voice, and his manner
was imperative.</p>

<p>“No, I won’t! Go and get your own knife,”
replied William, in a tone quite as ungracious
as that in which the request, or rather command,
had been made.</p>

<p>“I don’t wish to go into the house. Give
me your knife, I say. I only want it for a
minute.”</p>

<p>“I never lend my knife, nor give it, either,”
returned William. “Get your own.”</p>

<p>“You are the most disobliging fellow I ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
saw,” retorted Edgar angrily, rising up and
going into the house to get his own knife.
“Don’t ever ask me for a favour, for I’ll never
grant it.”</p>

<p>This very unbrotherly conversation took place
just beneath the window near which Mr. Harris,
the father of the lads, was seated. He overheard
it all, and was grieved, as may be supposed, that
his sons should treat each other so unkindly.
But he said nothing to them then, nor did he
let them know that he heard the language that
had passed between them.</p>

<p>In a little while Edgar returned, and as he
sat down in the place where he had been seated
before, he said,—</p>

<p>“No thanks to you for your old knife!
Keep it to yourself, and welcome. I wouldn’t
use it now if you were to give it to me.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you are so independent,” retorted
William. “I hope you will always
be so.”</p>

<p>And the boys fretted each other for some
time.</p>

<p>On the next day, Edgar was building a house
with sticks, and William was rolling a hoop.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
By accident the hoop was turned from its right
course, and broke down a part of Edgar’s house.
William was just going to say how sorry he was
for the accident, and to offer to repair the damage
that was done, when his brother, with his
face red with passion, cried out,—</p>

<p>“Just see what you have done! If you
don’t get away with your hoop, I’ll call father.
You did it on purpose.”</p>

<p>“Do go and call him! I’ll go with you,”
said William, in a sneering, tantalizing tone.
“Come, come along now.”</p>

<p>For a little while the boys stood and growled
at each other like two ill-natured dogs, and
then Edgar commenced repairing his house, and
William went on rolling his hoop again. The
latter was strongly tempted to repeat, in earnest,
what he had done at first by accident, by way
of retaliation upon his brother for his spiteful
manner toward him; but, being naturally of a
good disposition, and forgiving in his temper,
he soon forgot his bad feelings, and enjoyed his
play as much as he had done before.</p>

<p>This little circumstance Mr. Harris had also
observed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>A day or two afterwards, Edgar came to his
father with a complaint against his brother.</p>

<p>“I never saw such a boy,” he said. “He
will not do the least thing to oblige me. If I
ask him to lend me his knife, or ball, or anything
he has, he snaps me up short with a
refusal.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you don’t ask him right,” suggested
the father. “Perhaps you don’t speak
kindly to him. I hardly think that William
is ill-disposed and disobliging naturally. There
must be some fault on your part, I am sure.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know how I can be in fault, father,”
said Edgar.</p>

<p>“William refused to let you have his knife,
the other day, although he was not using it
himself, did he not?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Do you remember how you asked him for
it?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, not now, particularly.”</p>

<p>“Well, as I happened to overhear you, I can
repeat your words, though I hardly think I can
get your very tone and manner. Your words
were, ‘Here, lend me your knife, Bill!’ and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
your voice and manner were exceedingly offensive.
I did not at all wonder that William refused
your request. If you had spoken to him
in a kind manner, I am sure he would have
handed you his knife instantly. But no one
likes to be ordered, in a domineering way, to do
anything at all. I know you would resent it
in William, as quickly as he resents it in you.
Correct your own fault, my son, and in a little
while you will have no complaint to make of
William.”</p>

<p>Edgar felt rebuked. What his father said
he saw to be true.</p>

<p>“Whenever you want William to do anything
for you,” continued the father, “use kind
words instead of harsh ones, and you will find
him as obliging as you could wish. I have observed
you both a good deal, and I notice that
you rarely ever speak to William in a proper
manner, but you are rude and overbearing.
Correct this evil in yourself, and all will be
right with him. Kind words are far more
powerful than harsh words, and their effect a
hundred-fold greater.”</p>

<p>On the next day, as Edgar was at work in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
the garden, and William standing at the gate
looking on, Edgar wanted a rake that was
in the summer-house. He was just going
to say, “Go and get me that rake, Bill!”
but he checked himself, and made his request
in a different form, and in a better
tone than those words would have been uttered
in.</p>

<p>“Will you get me the small rake that lies in
the summer-house, William?” he said. The
words and tone involved a request, not a command,
and William instantly replied,—</p>

<p>“Certainly;” and bounded away to get the
rake for his brother.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Edgar, as he received the
rake.</p>

<p>“Don’t you want the watering-pot?” asked
William.</p>

<p>“Yes, I do; and you may bring it full of
water, if you please,” was the reply.</p>

<p>Off William went for the watering-pot, and
soon returned with it full of water. As he stood
near one of Edgar’s flower-beds, he forgot himself,
and stepped back with his foot upon a bed
of pansies.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>“There! just look at you!” exclaimed Edgar,
thrown off his guard.</p>

<p>William, who had felt drawn towards his
brother on account of his kind manner, was
hurt at this sudden change in his words and
tone. He was tempted to retort harshly,
and even to set his foot more roughly upon
the pansies. But he checked himself, and,
turning away, walked slowly from the garden.</p>

<p>Edgar, who had repented of his rude words
and unkind manner the moment he had time
to think, was very sorry that he had been
thrown off his guard, and resolved to be more
careful in the future. And he was more careful.
The next time he spoke to his brother,
it was in a kind and gentle manner, and he
saw its effect. Since then, he has been watchful
over himself, and now he finds that William
is one of the most obliging boys anywhere to
be found.</p>

<p>“So much for kind words, my son,” said his
father, on noticing the great change that had
taken place. “Never forget, throughout your
whole life, that kind words are far more potent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
than harsh ones. I have found them so, and
you have already proved the truth of what I
say.”</p>

<p>And so will every one who tries them. Make
the experiment, young friends, and you will find
it to succeed in every case.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="antiqua">The Broken Doll.</span></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/image034b.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">NEARLY all the unhappiness that exists
in the world has its origin in the
want of a proper control over the
desires and passions. This is as true
in childhood as in more advanced
age. Children are unhappy because they do
not possess many things they see; and too
often, in endeavouring to obtain what they
have no right to, they make themselves still
more unhappy. A spirit of covetousness is as
bad a spirit as can come into the heart; and
whoever has this spirit for a guest, cannot but
be, most of his time, very miserable.</p>

<p>Albert Hawkins, I am sorry to say, had
given place in his heart to this evil spirit of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
covetousness. Almost everything he saw he
desired to possess. Had it not been for this,
Albert would have been a very good boy. He
learned his lessons well, was obedient and attentive
at school and at home, and did not
take delight in hurting or annoying dumb animals
and insects, as too many boys do. But
his restless desire to have whatever he saw
marred all this, and produced much unhappiness
in his own mind, as well as in the minds
of his parents.</p>

<p>One day, on coming home from school, he
found his sister Ellen playing with a large new
doll that her father had bought for her.</p>

<p>“Oh, isn’t it beautiful!” he exclaimed.
“Where did you get it? Let me have it to
look at.”</p>

<p>And Albert caught hold of the doll and almost
forced it out of the hands of Ellen, who
resigned it with great reluctance. He then sat
down and held it in his lap, while Ellen stood
by, half in tears. She had only had it about
an hour, and she could not bear to let it go
from her. Albert, in his selfish desire to hold
in his hands the beautiful doll, did not think of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
how much pleasure he was depriving his sister,
who patiently waited minute after minute to
have it restored to her. At last, seeing that
her brother still kept possession of the doll, she
said, gently and kindly,—</p>

<p>“Won’t you give it to me now?” and she
put out her hand to take it as she spoke.</p>

<p>But Albert pushed her hand quickly away,
and said,—</p>

<p>“No, no; I’ve not done with it yet.”</p>

<p>Ellen looked disappointed. But she waited
still longer.</p>

<p>“Now, brother, give me my doll, won’t
you?” she said.</p>

<p>“Don’t be so selfish about your doll,” answered
Albert, rudely. “You shall have it
after a while, when I’ve done with it.”</p>

<p>Ellen now felt so vexed that she could not
keep from crying. As soon as Albert saw the
tears falling over her face, and heard her sob,
he became angry, and throwing the doll upon
the floor, exclaimed in a harsh voice,—</p>

<p>“There! Take your ugly old doll, if you
are so selfish about it!”</p>

<p>As the beautiful figure struck the floor, one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
of its delicate hands broke off from the wrist.
But even a sight of the injury he had done
did not soften the heart of Albert, who left
the room feeling very angry towards his sister.
He was trying to amuse himself in the
yard, about half an hour afterwards, when his
mother, who had been out, called to him
from the door. He went up to her, and she
said,—</p>

<p>“Albert, how came the hand of Ellen’s new
doll broken? Do you know? I have asked
her about it; but the only answer I can get
from her is in tears.”</p>

<p>Albert’s eyes fell immediately to the ground,
while his face became red.</p>

<p>“I hope you did not break it!” the mother
said, pained to see this confusion manifested by
her boy.</p>

<p>Now Albert, although of a covetous disposition,
never told a lie. He was a truthful boy,
and that was much in his favour. To lie is
most wicked and despicable. There is no
meaner character than a liar.</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am, I broke it,” he replied, without
any equivocation.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>“How did you do that, Albert?” asked his
mother.</p>

<p>“Ellen would not let me hold it, and I got
angry and threw it upon the floor. I didn’t
mean to break it.”</p>

<p>At this confession, Albert’s mother was very
much grieved.</p>

<p>“But what right had you to Ellen’s doll?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“I wanted to hold it.”</p>

<p>“But it was your sister’s, not yours; and
if she did not wish you to have it, that was
no reason why you should get angry and
break it.”</p>

<p>“But, indeed, mother, I didn’t mean to break
it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose you did. I should be very
sorry to think you were so wicked. Still, you
have been guilty of a great wrong to your sister;
and to this you have no doubt been led
by indulging in that covetous spirit of which I
have so often talked to you, and which, if not
overcome, may lead you into some great evil
when you become a man. But tell me just
how it happened.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>And Albert truthfully related what had
passed.</p>

<p>“I cannot tell you how much all this grieves
me,” his mother said. “Ellen never interferes
with your pleasures, and never covets your
playthings nor books, but you give her no
peace with anything she has. If your father
brings each of you home a book, yours is
thrown aside in a few moments, and you want
to look at hers. It is this covetous spirit—this
desiring to have what belongs to another—that
leads to stealing; and unless you put
it away from your heart, you will be in great
danger of more temptations than now assail
you. Poor Ellen! Her heart is almost broken
about her doll.”</p>

<p>“I am very sorry, mother,” replied Albert
in a penitent voice. “I wish I hadn’t touched
her doll. Don’t you think it can be mended?
Can’t I buy her a new hand for it? I will
take the money out of my box.”</p>

<p>“We will see about that, my dear. If you
can restore the hand, I think it is your duty
to do so. It will be nothing but simple justice,
and we should all be just one towards another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
in little as well as in great things. But your
first duty is to go to Ellen and try to comfort
her in her affliction, for it is a great grief for
her to have her beautiful doll broken. I found
her just now crying bitterly.”</p>

<p>All Albert’s better feelings came back into
his heart. He felt very sorry for Ellen, and
went in immediately to the room where she
was. He found her with her head leaning
down upon a table, weeping.</p>

<p>“Sister Ellen!” he said, speaking earnestly,
“I am so sorry I broke your doll’s hand.
Don’t cry, and I will take money out of my
box, and buy you a new hand for it.”</p>

<p>Albert’s voice was so kind, and so full of
sympathy, that Ellen felt better in a moment.
She lifted her head from the table and looked
round into her brother’s face.</p>

<p>“You will forgive me, won’t you, sister?”
he said. “I was angry and wicked, but I am
very sorry, and will try and never trouble you
any more. After dinner we will go out, and
see if we can’t find another hand, and I will
buy it for you out of my own money.”</p>

<p>Ellen’s tears all dried up; and she said in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
kind, gentle way, that she forgave her brother.
After dinner they went out together, and Albert
found a new hand, and bought it for his
sister. The doll is now as good as it was before;
and what is better, Albert has learned to
restrain his covetous spirit, and to leave Ellen
happy in the enjoyment of what is her own.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WILLIAM BAKER, and his brother
Thomas, and sister Ellen, were
playing on the green lawn in front
of their mother’s door, when a lad
named Henry Green came along
the road, and seeing the children enjoying
themselves, opened the gate and came in. He
was rather an ill-natured boy, and generally
took more pleasure in teasing and annoying
others than in being happy with them. When
William saw him coming in through the gate,
he called to him and said, in a harsh way,—</p>

<p>“You may just keep out, Henry Green, and
go about your business! We don’t want you
here.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>But Henry did not in the least regard what
William said. He came directly forward, and
joined in the sport as freely as if he had been
invited instead of repulsed. In a little while
he began to pull Ellen about rudely, and to
push Thomas so as nearly to throw them down
upon the grass.</p>

<p>“Go home, Henry Green! Nobody sent for
you! Nobody wants you here!” said William
Baker, in an angry tone.</p>

<p>It was of no use, however. William might
as well have spoken to the wind. His words
were unheeded by Henry, whose conduct became
ruder and more offensive.</p>

<p>Mrs. Baker, who sat at the window, saw and
heard all that was passing. As soon as she
could catch the eye of her excited son, she
beckoned him to come to her, which he
promptly did.</p>

<p>“Try kind words on him,” she said;
“you will find them more powerful than harsh
words. You spoke very harshly to Henry
when he came in, and I was sorry to hear
it.”</p>

<p>“It won’t do any good, mother. He’s a rude,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
bad boy, and I wish he would stay at home.
Won’t you make him go home?”</p>

<p>“First go and speak to him in a gentler way
than you did just now. Try to subdue him
with kindness.”</p>

<p>William felt that he had been wrong in letting
his angry feelings express themselves in
angry words. So he left his mother and went
down upon the lawn, where Henry was amusing
himself by trying to trip up the children
with a long stick, as they ran about on the
green.</p>

<p>“Henry,” he said, cheerfully and pleasantly,
“if you were fishing in the river, and I were
to come and throw stones in where your line
fell, and scare away all the fish, would you like
it?”</p>

<p>“No, I should not,” replied the lad.</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t be kind in me?”</p>

<p>“No, of course it wouldn’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, now, Henry”—William tried to smile
and to speak very pleasantly—“we are playing
here and trying to enjoy ourselves. Is it right
for you to come and interrupt us by tripping
up our feet, pulling us about, and pushing us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
down? I am sure you will not think so if you
reflect a moment. So don’t do it any more,
Henry.”</p>

<p>“No, I will not,” replied Henry promptly.
“I am sorry that I disturbed you. I didn’t
think what I was doing. And now I remember,
father told me not to stay, and I must run
home.”</p>

<p>So Henry Green went quickly away, and
the children were left to enjoy themselves.</p>

<p>“Didn’t I tell you that kind words were
more powerful than harsh words, William?”
said his mother, after Henry had gone away.
“When we speak harshly to our fellows, we
arouse their angry feelings, and then evil spirits
have power over them; but when we speak
kindly, we affect them with gentleness, and
good spirits flow into this latter state, and
excite in them better thoughts and intentions.
How quickly Henry changed, when you changed
your manner and the character of your language.
Do not forget this, my son. Do not forget
that kind words have double the power of harsh
ones.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">“WHAT have you there, boys?” asked
Captain Bland.</p>

<p>“A ship,” replied one of the lads
who were passing the captain’s neat
cottage.</p>

<p>“A ship! Let me see;” and the captain took
the little vessel, and examined it with as much
fondness as a child does a pretty toy. “Very
fair indeed; who made it?”</p>

<p>“I did,” replied one of the boys.</p>

<p>“You, indeed! Do you mean to be a sailor,
Harry?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I want father to get me
into the navy.”</p>

<p>“As a midshipman?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>Captain Bland shook his head.</p>

<p>“Better be a farmer, a physician, or a merchant.”</p>

<p>“Why so, captain?” asked Harry.</p>

<p>“All these are engaged in the doing of things
directly useful to society.”</p>

<p>“But I am sure, captain, that those who
defend us against our enemies, and protect all
who are engaged in commerce from wicked
pirates, are doing what is useful to society.”</p>

<p>“Their use, my lad,” replied Captain Bland,
“is certainly a most important one; but we
may call it rather negative than positive. The
civilian is engaged in building up and sustaining
society in doing good, through his active
employment, to his fellow-men. But military
and naval officers do not produce anything;
they only protect and defend.”</p>

<p>“But if they did not protect and defend,
captain, evil men would destroy society. It
would be of no use for the civilian to endeavour
to build up, if there were none to fight
against the enemies of the state.”</p>

<p>“Very true, my lad. The brave defender of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
his country cannot be dispensed with, and we
give him all honour. Still, the use of defence
and protection is not so high as the use of
building up and sustaining. The thorn that
wounds the hand stretched forth to pluck the
flower is not so much esteemed, nor of so much
worth, as the blossom it was meant to guard.
Still, the thorn performs a great use. Precisely
a similar use does the soldier or naval officer
perform to society; and it will be for you, my
lad, to decide as to which position you would
rather fill.”</p>

<p>“I never thought of that, captain,” said one
of the lads. “But I can see clearly how it is.
And yet I think those men who risk their lives
for us in war, deserve great honour. They
leave their homes, and remain away, sometimes
for years, deprived of all the comforts and blessings
that civilians enjoy, suffering frequently
great hardships, and risking their lives to defend
their country from her enemies.”</p>

<p>“It is all as you say,” replied Captain Bland;
“and they do, indeed, deserve great honour.
Their calling is one that exposes them to imminent
peril, and requires them to make many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
sacrifices; and they encounter not this peril
and sacrifice for their own good, but for the
good of others. Their lives do not pass so
evenly as do the lives of men who spend their
days in the peaceful pursuits of business, art,
or literature; and we could hardly wonder if
they lost some of the gentler attributes of the
human heart. In some cases this is so; but,
in very many cases, the reverse is true. We
find the man who goes fearlessly into battle,
and there, in defence of his country, deals
death and destruction unsparingly upon her
enemies, acting, when occasion offers, from the
most humane sentiments, and jeopardizing his
life to save the life of a single individual. Let
me relate to you a true story in illustration of
what I say.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“When the unhappy war that was waged
by the American troops in Mexico broke out, a
lieutenant in the navy, who had a quiet berth
at Washington, felt it to be his duty to go to
the scene of strife, and therefore asked to be
ordered to the Gulf of Mexico. His request
was complied with, and he received orders to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
go on board the steamer <i>Mississippi</i>, Commodore
Perry, then about to sail from Norfolk to Vera
Cruz.</p>

<p>“Soon after the <i>Mississippi</i> arrived out, and
before the city and castle were taken, a terrible
‘norther’ sprung up, and destroyed much shipping
in the harbour. One vessel, on which
were a number of passengers, was thrown high
upon a reef; and when morning broke, the
heavy sea was making a clear breach through
her. She lay about a mile from the <i>Mississippi</i>,
and it soon became known on board the
steamer that a mother and her infant were
in the wreck, and that, unless succour came
speedily, they would perish. The lieutenant
of whom I speak immediately ordered out a
boat’s crew, and although the sea was rolling
tremendously, and the ‘norther’ still blowing
a hurricane, started to the rescue. Right
in the teeth of the wind were the men compelled
to pull their boat, and so slowly did they
proceed that it took more than two hours to
gain the wreck.</p>

<p>“At one time they actually gave up, and the
oars lay inactive in their hands. At this crisis,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
the brave but humane officer, pointing with one
hand to the fortress of San Juan de Ulloa,
upon which a fire had already commenced, and
with the other to the wreck, exclaimed, with
noble enthusiasm,—</p>

<p>“‘Pull away, men! I would rather save the
life of that woman and her child, than have the
honour of taking the castle!’</p>

<p>“Struck by the noble, unselfish, and truly
humane feelings of their officer, the crew bent
with new vigour to their oars. In a little while
the wreck was gained, and the brave lieutenant
had the pleasure of receiving into his arms
the almost inanimate form of the woman, who
had been lashed to the deck, and over whom
the waves had been beating, at intervals, all
night.</p>

<p>“In writing home to his friends, after the
excitement of the adventure was over, the
officer spoke of the moment when he rescued
that mother and child from the wreck as the
proudest of his life.</p>

<p>“Afterwards he took part in the bombardment
of Vera Cruz, and had command, in turn,
of the naval battery, where he faithfully and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
energetically performed his duty as an officer
in the service of his country. He was among
the first of those who entered the captured city;
but pain, not pleasure, filled his mind, as he
looked around and saw death and destruction on
every hand. The arms of his country had been
successful; the officer had bravely contributed
his part in the work; but he frankly owns
that he experienced far more delight in saving
the woman he had borne from the wreck, than
he could have felt had he been the commander
of the army that reduced the city.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Wherever duty calls, my lads,” concluded
the captain, “you will find that brave officer.
He will never shrink from the post of danger,
if his country have need of him, nor will he
ever be deaf to the appeal of humanity; but so
long as he is a true man, just so long will he
delight more in saving than in destroying.”</p>

</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/image053b.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">EMMA’S aunt had given her a sixpence,
and now the question was, what
should she buy with it?</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what I will do,
mother,” she said, changing her mind
for the tenth time.</p>

<p>“Well, dear, what have you determined upon
now?”</p>

<p>“I’ll save my sixpence until I get a good
many more, and then I’ll buy me a handsome
wax doll. Wouldn’t you do that, mother, if
you were me?”</p>

<p>“If I were you, I suppose I should do just
as you will,” replied Emma’s mother, smiling.</p>

<p>“But, mother, don’t you think that would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
be a nice way to do? I get a good many
pennies and sixpences, you know, and could
soon save enough to buy me a beautiful wax
doll.”</p>

<p>“I think it would be better,” said Mrs.
Lee, “for you to save up your money and buy
something worth having.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t a large wax doll worth having?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes; for a little girl like you.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll save up my money, until I get
enough to buy me a doll as big as Sarah Johnson’s.”</p>

<p>In about an hour afterwards, Emma came to
her mother, and said,—</p>

<p>“I’ve just thought what I will do with my
sixpence. I saw such a beautiful book at a
shop yesterday! It was full of pictures, and
the price was just sixpence. I’ll buy that book.”</p>

<p>“But didn’t you say, a little while ago, that
you were going to save your money until you
had enough to buy a doll?”</p>

<p>“I know I did, mother; but I didn’t think
about the book then. And it will take so long
before I can save up money enough to get a new
doll. I think I will buy the book.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>“Very well, dear,” replied Mrs. Lee.</p>

<p>Not long after, Emma changed her mind
again.</p>

<p>On the next day her mother said to her,—</p>

<p>“Your aunt Mary is very ill, and I am going
to see her. Do you wish to go with me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, mother, I should like to go. I am so
sorry that aunt Mary is ill. What ails her?”</p>

<p>“She is never very well, and the least cold
makes her worse. The last time she was here
she took cold.”</p>

<p>As they were about leaving the house, Emma
said,—</p>

<p>“I’ll take my sixpence with me, and spend
it, mother.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to buy?” asked Mrs.
Lee.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied Emma. “Sometimes
I think I will buy some cakes; and then
I think I will get a whole sixpence worth of
cream candy—I like it so.”</p>

<p>“Have you forgotten the book?”</p>

<p>“Oh no. Sometimes I think I will buy the
book. Indeed, I don’t know what to buy.”</p>

<p>In this undecided state of mind, Emma<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
started with her mother to see her aunt. They
had not gone far before they met a poor woman
with some very pretty bunches of flowers for
sale. She carried them on a tray. She stopped
before Mrs. Lee and her little girl, and asked if
they would not buy some flowers.</p>

<p>“How much are they a bunch?” asked
Emma.</p>

<p>“Sixpence,” replied the woman.</p>

<p>“Mother, I’ll tell you what I will do with
my sixpence,” said Emma, her face brightening
with the thought that came into her mind. “I
will buy a bunch of flowers for aunt Mary.
You know how she loves flowers. Can’t I do
it, mother?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, dear. Do it, by all means, if you
think you can give up the nice cream candy or
the picture book for the sake of gratifying your
aunt.”</p>

<p>Emma did not hesitate a moment, but selected
a very handsome bunch of flowers, and paid her
sixpence to the woman with a feeling of real
pleasure.</p>

<p>Aunt Mary was very much pleased with the
bouquet Emma brought her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>“The sight of these flowers, and their delightful
perfume, really makes me feel better,”
she said, after she had held them in her hand
for a little while. “I am very much obliged
to my niece for thinking of me.”</p>

<p>That evening Emma looked up from a book
which her mother had bought her as they returned
home from aunt Mary’s, and with which
she had been much entertained, and said,—</p>

<p>“I think the spending of my sixpence gave
me a double pleasure.”</p>

<p>“How so, dear?” asked Mrs. Lee.</p>

<p>“I made aunt happy, and the flower-woman
too. Didn’t you notice how pleased the flower-woman
looked? I shouldn’t wonder if she had
little children at home, and thought about the
bread that sixpence would buy them when I
paid it to her. Don’t you think she did?”</p>

<p>“I cannot tell that, Emma,” replied her
mother; “but I shouldn’t at all wonder if it
were as you suppose. And so it gives you
pleasure to think you have made others happy?”</p>

<p>“Indeed it does.”</p>

<p>“Acts of kindness,” replied Emma’s mother,
“always produce a feeling of pleasure. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
every one may know. And it is the purest and
truest pleasure we experience in this world.
Try and remember this little incident of the
flowers as long as you live, my child; and let
the thought of it remind you that every act of
self-denial brings to the one who makes it a
sweet delight.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">“TAKE care of that wolf, my son,” said
Mrs. Maylie to a boy about twelve
years old, who had come from
school in a very ill humour with
a playmate, and kept saying harsh
things about him, which were but oral evidences
of the unkind feelings he cherished
within.</p>

<p>“What wolf, mother?” asked Alfred, looking
up with surprise.</p>

<p>“The wolf in your heart. Have you already
forgotten what I told you last evening about
the wild beasts within you?”</p>

<p>“But you told us too,” spoke up little Emily,
“about the innocent lambs. There are gentle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
and good animals in us, as well as fierce and
evil ones.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes. Good affections are the innocent
animals of your hearts, and evil affections the
cruel beasts of prey that are lurking there, ever
ready, if you will permit them, to rise up and
destroy your good affections. Take care, my
children, how you permit the wild beasts to
rage. In a moment that you know not, they
may ravage some sweet spot.”</p>

<p>“But what did you mean by saying that
there was a <i>wolf</i> in brother Alfred? Tell us
the meaning of that, mother.”</p>

<p>“Yes, do, mother,” joined in Alfred, whose
ill humour had already begun to subside. “I
want to know what the wolf in my heart
means.”</p>

<p>“Do you know anything about the nature
of wolves?” asked Mrs. Maylie.</p>

<p>“They are very cruel, and love to seize and
eat up dear little innocent lambs,” said Emily.</p>

<p>“Yes, my children, their nature is cruel, and
they prey upon innocent creatures. Until now,
Alfred, you have always loved to be with your
playmate, William Jarvis.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>Alfred was silent.</p>

<p>“Was it not so, my dear?”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am; I used to like him.”</p>

<p>“Frequently you would get from me a fine
large apple, or a choice flower from the garden,
to present to him. But the tender and innocent
feelings that prompted you to do this have
perished. Some wolf has rushed in and destroyed
them. Is it not so?”</p>

<p>Alfred sat in thoughtful silence.</p>

<p>“Think, my son,” continued Mrs. Maylie,
“how innocent, like gentle lambs, were your
feelings until now. When you thought of
William, it was with kindness. When you
played by his side, it was with a warm, even
tender regard. But it is not so now. Some
beast of prey has devoured these lambs—these
innocent creatures that sported in your bosom.
If the angry, raging wolf has not eaten them
up, where are they? Before you permitted
yourself to feel anger against William, gentle
creatures leaped about happily in your breast;
but you feel them no longer—only the wolf is
there. Will you let him still rage, and devour
your lambs, or will you drive him out?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>“I will drive him out, mother, if I can. How
shall I do it?” Alfred said earnestly, and with
a troubled look.</p>

<p>“By resisting him even unto the death. You
have the power. You have weapons that will
prevail. Try to forget the fault of William;
try to excuse him; think of his good qualities;
and assure yourself of what I know to be true—that
he never meant to offend you. If the
angry wolf growl in your bosom, thrust bravely
at him, as you would, were you, weapon in
hand, defending a sheepfold; and he will and
must retire, or die at your feet. Then innocent
lambs will again be seen, and their sports
delight your heart. Then you will feel no
more anger towards your young friend, but love
instead.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I am angry with William,
mother,” Alfred said.</p>

<p>“But you were just now.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but the wolf is no longer in my heart,”
the boy replied smiling. “He has been driven
out.”</p>

<p>“And innocent creatures can now sport there
unharmed. I am glad of it. Do not again,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
Alfred, do not any of you, my children, permit
ravenous beasts to prey upon the lambs of your
flocks. Fly from them in as much terror as you
would fly from the presence of a wolf, a tiger,
or a lion, were one to meet you in a forest.
They are equally hurtful—one injures the body,
the other the soul.”</p>

<p>“Tell us now, mother, about the wolf
that had nearly killed uncle Harper when
he was a little boy no bigger than me,” spoke
up Charley, the youngest of Mrs. Maylie’s treasures.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, mother, tell us all about it,” said
Alfred.</p>

<p>“I’ve told you that very often,” the mother
returned.</p>

<p>“But we want to hear it again. Tell it to
us; won’t you, mother?”</p>

<p>“Oh, certainly. Many years ago, when I
was a little girl not bigger than Emily, we lived
at the foot of a high mountain, in a wild, unsettled
country. There were but few neighbours,
and they were at great distances from
us. At that time bears, wolves, and panthers
were in the region where we lived, and often<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
destroyed the sheep of the settlers, and otherwise
annoyed them. The men used frequently
to go out and hunt them, and kill
off these their forest enemies in great numbers.</p>

<p>“One day, when your uncle Harper was
about five years old, our father took us in his
waggon to visit a neighbour about six miles up
among the mountains. This neighbour had a
little boy just Harper’s age, and they were
together in the garden and about the house
all the morning. After dinner, they were
dressed up nicely, and again went out to
play.</p>

<p>“‘Come,’ said Harper’s companion, ‘let us go
and see brother Allen’s bird-trap. He caught
three pheasants yesterday. Maybe we’ll find
one in it to-day.’</p>

<p>“Harper was very willing to go. And so
they started right into the woods; for the forest
came up close to the house, and went off quite
out of sight. They had not been gone long
before a neighbour, who lived about a mile off,
came over to say that a very large wolf had
been seen a few hours before.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>“‘Where is Harper?’ my mother asked
quickly, going to the door and looking out.</p>

<p>“‘I saw him a little while ago, playing about
here with Johnny,’ some one replied.</p>

<p>“‘But where is he now?’ and our mother
went out of doors, looking all around the house
and in the garden.</p>

<p>“‘They’ve gone off to my bird-trap, without
doubt,’ said Allen, a stout boy about sixteen
years of age. ‘Johnny has been there several
times within a day or two.’</p>

<p>“‘Do run and see,’ urged our mother. Allen
took up his gun and started off quickly towards
the place where he had set his bird-trap. Two
or three took other directions; for, now that it
was known a wolf had been seen, all were
alarmed at the absence of the children. In about
five minutes after Allen had left the house, we
were startled by the sharp crack of a rifle in
the direction he had taken. For the next five
minutes we waited in dreadful suspense; then
we were gladdened by the sight of Allen, bringing
home the two children. But when we heard
all that had occurred, we trembled from head
to foot. Allen had gone quickly towards the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
place where he expected to find the little truants.
When he came in sight of the trap, he
saw them on the ground close to it, and was
just going to call out to them to take care or
they would spring it, when the dark body of a
large wolf came quickly in between him and
the children. There was not a moment to be
lost; if the cruel beast reached them, destruction
would be inevitable. Quickly presenting
his rifle, he took a steady aim and fired. A
fierce howl answered the report: as the smoke
arose from before his eyes, he saw the ‘gaunt
gray robber’ of the wilderness rolling upon the
ground. The bullet had sped with unerring
certainty.</p>

<p>“How thankful we were,” added Mrs. Maylie,
“when, knowing how great had been the
danger, we saw the children safe from all
harm!”</p>

<p>“Does uncle Harper remember it?” asked
Charley.</p>

<p>“Yes; he says he can just remember something
about it; but he was a very little boy
then.”</p>

<p>“That was a <i>real</i> wolf,” remarked Emily;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
“but the wolves, and tigers, and lambs you
have been telling us about are not real, are
they? Real animals can’t live in us.”</p>

<p>“If there was nothing real about them, could
they hurt you, dear?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“But the wolves I spoke about do hurt you.
Must they not be real then?”</p>

<p>“Not real like the big hairy wolf I saw at
the show?”</p>

<p>“Oh no; not real like that; not clothed in
flesh; but still real, so far as power to harm
you is concerned: and surely that is reality
enough. Don’t you think so?”</p>

<p>“Yes, real that way. But still,” Alfred
said, “I can’t understand how a real wolf can
be in me; for a wolf is much bigger than I
am.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t mean a flesh and blood wolf,
but something in you that partakes of the
wolf’s cruel nature, and, like the wolf, seeks to
destroy all in you that is good, and harmless,
and innocent. There may be in you something
that corresponds to the fierce nature of
the wolf, and something that corresponds to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
gentle nature of the lamb. Both of these cannot
be active at the same time. If you let the
wolf rule, your gentle lambs, as I before told
you, will be destroyed.”</p>

<p>The children now understood their mother
better, though they could not clearly comprehend
all that was meant by the wild beasts
and innocent creatures of the human heart.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">“WHY, Arthur,” exclaimed Mrs. Mason,
on coming into the room where she
had left her two boys playing, and
finding one of them there with a
bunch of flowers in his hand; “how
came you to pull my flowers? Haven’t I positively
forbidden you to do so?”</p>

<p>“I did not do it, mother. I did not do it.
It was John.”</p>

<p>“Where is John?”</p>

<p>“He’s in the yard.”</p>

<p>“Call him in,” said Mrs. Mason.</p>

<p>While Arthur was at the window calling to
his brother, Mr. Mason, the father, came into
the room.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>“John has been pulling my flowers. Isn’t
it too bad that a boy as big as he is should
have so little consideration? They were coming
out into bloom beautifully.”</p>

<p>Just then John entered, with a bunch of
flowers also in his hand.</p>

<p>“John, how came you to pull my flowers?”
said Mrs. Mason. “You knew it was wrong.”</p>

<p>“I did not think, when I pulled off a rosebud
and two or three larkspurs,” replied John.</p>

<p>“Two or three larkspurs and a rosebud!
Why, your hand is full of flowers.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but William Jones gave me all but the
larkspurs and the rosebud. Indeed, mother, I
didn’t touch any more; and I am sorry I took
them; but I forgot that it was wrong when I
did so.”</p>

<p>“But Arthur says you pulled that large bunch
in his hand.”</p>

<p>“Arthur knows I didn’t. He knows he
pulled them himself, and that I told him he’d
better not do it; but he said he’d as much
right to the flowers as I had.”</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Mason both looked at Arthur
in surprise and displeasure. His countenance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
showed that he had been guilty of wrongly
accusing his brother.</p>

<p>“Is it true that you did pull the flowers,
Arthur?” asked his mother.</p>

<p>But Arthur was silent.</p>

<p>“Speak, sir!” said the father sternly. “Did
you pull the flowers?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“And then falsely accused your brother of
the wrong you had done. That my boy should
be guilty of an evil act like this! I could not
have believed it. It is a wicked thing to tell
a lie to hide a fault, simply; but falsely to
accuse another of what we have ourselves done,
is still more wicked. Can it be possible that a
son of mine has fallen so low? It grieves me
to the heart.”</p>

<p>Mr. Mason spoke as he felt. He was deeply
grieved. Nothing had occurred for a long time
that so hurt him. He loved honesty and truth;
but how opposite to both had been the conduct
of his boy!</p>

<p>“Go up to your chamber, and stay there
until I see you or send for you,” he said; and
Arthur retired in shame from the presence of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
parents, and the brother he had so meanly attempted
to injure. Of course he felt very unhappy.
How could he feel otherwise? The
rebuking words of his father fell like heavy
blows upon his heart, and the pain they occasioned
was for a long time severely felt.</p>

<p>What punishment the parents thought it
right to inflict upon Arthur we do not know;
but, no doubt, he was punished in some way, as
he deserved. And besides this, he had the still
severer punishment which always follows that
meanest fault of which any one can be guilty—that
of accusing another and innocent person
of what we have ourselves done.</p>

<p>Bad as this fault is, it is, alas! too common.
But no manly, honest-minded, truthful boy will
be betrayed into it. To the better impulses of
our young readers who have been so wicked
as to fall into this sin, either from sudden impulse
or deliberate purpose, we would earnestly
appeal, and beg of them to think more wisely
and act more justly in the future. No cause is
ever made better, but always worse, by a falsehood.
Even where detection does not follow,
suspicion is almost always created; for it is impossible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
for a boy to tell a lie without betraying
it in the face or voice, and causing a doubt
to pass through the minds of his parents, and set
them to making inquiry into the truth or falsehood
of what he has stated.</p>

<p>Truth—the open, bold, honest truth—is always
the best, always the wisest, always the
safest for every one, in any and all circumstances.
Let no boy deviate from it, even though he have
been guilty of a fault. Better—a thousand
times better—is it to own to the wrong, and
keep a clear conscience.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="antiqua">A Story about a Dog.</span></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/image059b.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“TELL us a story, father, before we go to
bed,” said a little boy, who spoke for
two brothers as well as for himself.</p>

<p>“What shall it be about?” asked
Mr. Melville, their father.</p>

<p>“Oh, about a dog. I love to hear stories
about dogs.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes! let it be about a dog.”</p>

<p>“Yes, papa, let it be about a dog,” ran
through the circle of children.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t you rather hear a story about
the innocent lamb; the pure, snow-white lamb
that sports in the green meadows?” said the
father. “Dogs are evil animals.”</p>

<p>“Oh no, father! dogs are not evil animals.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
You don’t call our Carlo an evil animal? He’s
a good, kind, generous dog. Didn’t he save
the life of Mr. Graham’s little Harry, when he
fell into the river? And doesn’t he love us,
and go with us everywhere? And didn’t he
jump on Mr. Parker’s Nero and beat him,
when he flew out at us as we were passing,
and was going to bite us? I am sure
Carlo is a good dog. He watches our house at
night, and keeps all the robbers away.”</p>

<p>“Carlo is one of the better class of dogs,”
said Mr. Melville. “Many of these animals
have generous qualities, and can be taught by
man to perform many good acts; but I hardly
think the dog can be called a good animal, like
the noble horse or the useful cow and sheep.
These serve man in a great variety of ways,
and do not, even in their wild state, prey upon
other animals, or attack and injure man as the
dog will. The only use of the dog is for a
protection against evil; and he is able to do
this from something in him that is cruel and
destructive. But I own that in some dogs
there are to be found many noble and generous
qualities; but these they derive from long association<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
with man, and from being employed
by him from one generation to another in doing
useful things. The dogs of St. Bernard, of
which you have so often read, are noble specimens
of this improved race. So are the Newfoundland
dogs. But still they are not good
and innocent,—like sheep, for instance, or cows,
or like the gentle dove. Those are truly innocent
animals, and correspond in nature to certain
good affections in our minds.”</p>

<p>But the children still thought that Carlo
must be a good animal, and insisted that it was
so, and upon having a story about a dog instead
of a lamb.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Mr. Melville: “I will tell
you a story about a dog, and a very interesting
one it is too. I heard it or read about it somewhere
recently, but I cannot now tell where.”</p>

<p>“Tell it, father, do tell it,” urged the children.</p>

<p>Mr. Melville then told the following story:—</p>

<p>“There was a boy,—we will call his name
Thomas,—whose father bought him a fine horse,
upon which he used to ride out almost every
day, accompanied by a large Newfoundland dog<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
named Bruno. One day Thomas had his horse
brought out for a ride, and after he had mounted
the animal, he whistled for Bruno, who was
lying on a mat in front of the house. But
Bruno only wagged his tail. He did not even
lift his head from between his fore paws,
although his dark bright eyes were fixed upon
his young master. ‘Come, Bruno, come!’
called Thomas. But the dog only wagged his
tail more quickly. ‘You are a lazy fellow,
Bruno,’ said Thomas, in a half-chiding, disappointed
tone. ‘I shan’t half enjoy my ride
unless you come.’ And he whistled loud for
Bruno, as he gave his horse the rein and trotted
off. Although he looked back and called for
Bruno many times, as he rode away, the dog
evinced no disposition to follow him.</p>

<p>“It was near sunset, and the father and
mother of Thomas were sitting in front of their
door, enjoying the cool refreshing air. Bruno
still lay upon the mat, and seemed to be sleeping.</p>

<p>“‘I wonder why that dog didn’t go with
Thomas?’ said the father, looking at Bruno.</p>

<p>“‘He’s lazy to-day,’ replied the mother.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
‘Thomas called him, and tried his best to get
him off with him, as usual, but Bruno never
stirred.’</p>

<p>“On hearing his name, the dog rose up, and
came and rubbed himself against his master,
who patted him kindly upon the head. While
standing thus by his master’s side, Bruno all at
once pricked up his ears and rose, and seemed
all attention. Almost at the same instant the
father of Thomas heard the distant clattering
of a horse’s hoofs, which drew nearer every
moment. He arose quickly; as he did so,
Bruno gave a short, uneasy bark, and went a
few steps towards the road, holding his head
very high, and looking first in one direction and
then in another. This suspense did not continue
long. In less than a minute from the
time the first distant sound was heard, they
saw the horse of Thomas come dashing down
the road at a fearful speed, with his little rider
clinging to his neck. The house stood nearly
a hundred yards from the road, and the horse
approaching at such a rapid rate, that, although
the father sprang forward to catch him, if possible,
at the moment of passing, yet he was instantly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
conscious that before he could possibly
reach the road the frightened animal would be
beyond his reach. Just as his mind felt this
painful certainty, Bruno went past him like an
arrow, cleared the fence at a bound, and at the
moment the horse was passing the gate caught
him by the bridle. To this he held on, checking
the animal’s speed so much that his master
found it easy to come up with and stop him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, what a noble dog!” cried the children.
“How Thomas must have loved him!”</p>

<p>“But how,” said one, “did Bruno know that
the horse was going to run away?”</p>

<p>“He did not know it,” said Mr. Melville.</p>

<p>“Then why didn’t he go with Thomas? He
must have known it, father.”</p>

<p>“Oh no; that doesn’t follow, my son, at all.
But the Lord, in his omnipotence and providence,
knew what would take place, and provided just
the means that were needed to save Thomas
from being killed.”</p>

<p>“Then he made Bruno stay at home that he
might be ready to save his young master’s
life?” said one of the children.</p>

<p>“The Lord’s protecting Spirit is everywhere,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
replied Mr. Melville, “and governs in all circumstances
by which we are preserved from
harm. Without doubt, it was an influence
from Heaven that produced in the dog an indisposition
to go with Thomas.”</p>

<p>“How good the Lord is!” said the child who
had last spoken, in a thoughtful tone.</p>

<p>“Yes, my dear,” returned Mr. Melville;
“the Lord is good to all, and kind even to the
unthankful. He maketh his sun to shine upon
the evil and the good, and sendeth his rain upon
the just and the unjust.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="antiqua">The Discontented Shepherd.</span></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/image081b.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IN a quiet valley there once dwelt a
shepherd, who led a peaceful, happy
life. He had large flocks, from whose
fleecy backs the wool was regularly
shorn, and sold to the merchants;
and the merchants paid him money, with which
he bought all things needful for health and
bodily comfort.</p>

<p>One day the shepherd drove his flocks to
the sea-side, and as he looked abroad upon the
great expanse of water, and saw the ships moving
over its surface, he felt, for the first time,
discontented with his lot. A desire to see the
world took possession of his mind.</p>

<p>“I will no longer shut myself up in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
narrow valley,” he said. “I will become a
merchant. I will pass over the wide sea, and
go among the people of many lands.”</p>

<p>So the shepherd sold his flocks, and with
the money bought merchandise, which he placed
in a ship, and started for a distant country.
During the first day after leaving the land, he
could do little else but admire the wonderful
ocean upon whose surface he was sailing, and
think how happy he was at having escaped the
dull life of a shepherd in an unknown vale.
But on the second day after leaving the land,
the motion of the ship made him very sick.
He could no longer enjoy the great expanse of
ocean and sky spread out above and around
him, but had to remain in the cabin, unable
even to lift his head from his pillow. As he
lay sick in the dark, narrow cabin, filled with
polluted air, he thought of the green shady
places, cool refreshing streams, and pure air of
his native valley, and, for the first time, he
repented of what he had done.</p>

<p>It was more than a week before the shepherd
could go upon deck, and feel pleasure in
the sky and ocean as he had done at first.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>At last the vessel arrived at its destined
place: the shepherd landed his goods and offered
them for sale. He soon found a merchant
willing to buy them. The price was agreed
upon, the merchandise delivered, and the money
demanded. But it happened, as it almost always
happens when men get dissatisfied with
the business or calling with which they are
perfectly familiar, and enter into one they
know nothing about, the shepherd fell into dishonest
hands. The merchant refused to pay
him his money.</p>

<p>In order to get this wrong redressed, the
shepherd called upon a magistrate of the country,
who promised to see that justice was done
to him. But the merchant knew the magistrate
to be as unfitted for his calling as he was
for his, and so he offered him a bribe, which
the wicked magistrate accepted. In vain did
the shepherd seek for justice at his hands; no
justice could he get. His importunities at last
became so great, that the magistrate threatened
to have him put into prison if he troubled him
any more.</p>

<p>In his own peaceful valley there was no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
wrong and oppression like this. The merchants
who came for his fleece were good and true
men, and paid the prices agreed upon. The
ignorant shepherd had not dreamed that there
were such wicked men in the world as this
merchant and this magistrate, into whose hands
he had fallen.</p>

<p>In a strange land, among strange people,
thousands of miles away from his home, and
all his money and property gone, the poor
shepherd was about giving up in despair.
But he bethought him that he would go to
the king of the country, and ask justice at his
hands.</p>

<p>The king, when he heard the shepherd’s
story, was very angry at the wrong that had
been done in his kingdom. He sent immediately,
and had the magistrate and the merchant
brought before him and confronted with
their accuser. On seeing the shepherd, their
hearts became filled with alarm, and their faces
betrayed what was in their hearts. When accused
they could answer nothing. So the king
caused the merchant to pay the shepherd for
his goods; and besides, imposed upon him a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
heavy fine. From the magistrate he took away
his office, and had him cast into prison.</p>

<p>As soon as the shepherd had received his
money, he returned in the first ship that sailed
for his native country, and buying more flocks,
was ever after contented to follow them in the
peaceful valley where no wrong, oppression, or
dishonesty had yet come.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="antiqua">The Shilling.</span></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/image086b.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">GEORGE HANSON’S uncle had given
him a shilling; and George, like most
boys, felt very anxious to spend it.
But, among his many wants, he
found it a hard matter to decide
upon which to gratify. If it had been a half-crown
instead of a shilling, the difficulty would
have been lessened, for then George could have
supplied at least half a dozen wants. But it
was only a shilling.</p>

<p>He stood at the window, looking out upon
the passengers who were going quickly by, the
frosty air of December giving lightness to
many a step that, in a milder day, would have
been less hurriedly taken. While standing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
here, his mind half made up to gratify his love
of cakes and oranges by a whole shilling’s
worth, a man went by with some pretty little
glass toys in a box, which he held up to the
window, and asked if he did not want to buy
some.</p>

<p>George beckoned to the man to stop, and
then ran to the front door. The man was a
glass-blower, and had manufactured some handsome
birds, and sheep, and deer, from white
glass, which looked, certainly, curious and
beautiful.</p>

<p>“How much is this?” asked George, pointing
to a bird of paradise.</p>

<p>“Eighteen-pence.”</p>

<p>“But I’ve only got a shilling,” returned
George.</p>

<p>“Well, here’s a robin redbreast for a shilling;
and here’s a deer, and a sheep. All
these on this side are a shilling.”</p>

<p>But George liked the bird of paradise best
of all, and couldn’t think of taking anything
else.</p>

<p>While the man stood trying to persuade him
to buy one of the birds that were sold for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
shilling, George looked up and saw going by a
poor old man, who was bent with age. He
led a little girl by the hand, who appeared to
shrink in the cold. The old man looked sick
and feeble, and very poor.</p>

<p>“They shall have my shilling!” exclaimed
George, speaking from a sudden impulse; and
he stepped forward, and placing the coin in the
old man’s hand, said, as he did so,—</p>

<p>“I was just going to spend this for a little
glass toy that would be broken in a day. But
I want it put to a better use. Take it, and
buy something for your little girl.”</p>

<p>The poor old man stopped, and said, with a
look of surprise and pleasure as he received the
coin,—</p>

<p>“Thank you, my young master! This will
give my little Alice a nice bowl of bread and
milk for her supper and breakfast. She will
think of you with a grateful heart while she
eats them.”</p>

<p>“Well done, my good boy!” said the glass-blower,
as the old man went on his way.
“That poor little girl’s bread and milk will
taste sweet to her to-night. And as a reward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
for your generous self-denial, here is the bird of
paradise that has pleased you so much: take
it.”</p>

<p>But George drew back, and said he hardly
thought that would be right.</p>

<p>“Why not, I wonder?” returned the man.
“Am I to be outdone in generosity by a boy?
Take it, and whenever you look upon it let it
teach you this lesson—that it is more blessed
to give than to receive; for I am sure the
thought of the good done to the old man and
the little girl will be more pleasant to you than
the thought of possessing this pretty toy.”</p>

<p>And so it was. The toy pleased for a short
time only, but the thought of the little girl
who had been made happy by his shilling never
passed through his mind without giving him
pleasure.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">“FATHER,” said Henry Thompson, a boy
just eleven years old, “won’t you buy
me a gun?”</p>

<p>“A gun! Oh no; I can’t buy
you a gun,” Mr. Thompson replied in
a decided voice.</p>

<p>Henry turned away disappointed, and went
out of his father’s warehouse, into which he
had come specially to ask for a gun. He
was not pleased at the refusal he had met
with, and felt much inclined, as are too many
children, to indulge hard thoughts against
his kind father for not gratifying his wish.
As he walked along, he met Alfred Lyon,
a lad about his own age, whose father had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
given him a gun, and who then had it on his
shoulder.</p>

<p>“Come, Henry,” said Alfred, “I’m going out
a-shooting. Won’t you go with me?”</p>

<p>Henry at once said “Yes.” It was a holiday,
and his mother had told him that he
might go out and spend the morning as he
liked, only that he must not go into danger,
nor harm anything. So he did not hesitate to
go with Alfred. He had seen the little boy
the day before, and then learned that he had
received from his father the present of a gun,
and this was what had made him desire to
have one also.</p>

<p>The two little boys then took their way to
the woods. It was a bright day in early summer.
The trees were all covered with tender
foliage, the fields bright and green, and the
singing birds made the air thrill with delicious
melody. To mar this scene of innocence, beauty,
and peace, came these two thoughtless boys.
They saw the woods mantled in their dark,
rich drapery, that moved gracefully in the light
breeze; but all their majestic beauty was lost
to their eyes. They thought only whether the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
thick, green masses of leaves contained a robin
or harmless red-bird, as a victim to their murderous
gun. The green fields, too, were pleasant
to their eyes only so far as they might conceal,
in their blossoming hedgerows, a victim
wren or sparrow. And the sweet trilling of the
lovely songsters, as it floated from wood and
field, though it gladdened their ears, affected
them not with a pure and innocent pleasure.
I grieve to make such a record of these two
lads, but it is, alas! too true. Both together,
were they to labour over their task from this
hour of their boyhood until threescore and ten
years had been numbered to them, could not
make even a little yellow bird,—nay, not so
much as a feather like one shed from its downy
wing; and yet they were eager to destroy the
lovely creature made by God’s own hand, and
all from an idle love of sport.</p>

<p>Well, Alfred and Henry soon arrived at the
woods.</p>

<p>“Hark!” said Alfred, “there is a robin singing
in that maple! Be still, and I will shoot
him.”</p>

<p>Henry stood very still, while Alfred moved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
stealthily along, with his gun in his hand, until
he stood nearly under the maple-tree. The
robin, all unconscious of danger, was singing
his song of gladness—a tribute of praise to Him
who had fashioned him curiously, and with inconceivable
wisdom and skill—when the boy
raised his gun, took a deadly aim, and fired.
The breast of the robin was still heaving, and
his throat trembling with the song, when the
swift-winged shot entered his side, and pierced
his little heart. He fell at the feet of his murderer.
One would have thought, that when
Alfred and Henry saw the bleeding bird, lying
dead on the ground, their hearts would have
been filled with sorrow. But not so. A shout
of joy followed this cruel exploit. The bird
was picked up, and a string tied about its
neck, and borne along with them, as the triumphant
evidence of Alfred’s skill with his
weapon.</p>

<p>Next an oriole was discovered, flying from a
bush near them, and alighting upon the branch
of a tree, high up in the air.</p>

<p>“Now, let me shoot,” said Henry; and
Alfred suffered his companion to take the gun.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
He proved to be not quite so good a marksman
as Alfred. But he struck the oriole, and
wounded him. The bird fluttered to another
tree, upon a limb of which he alighted. Here
he clung, with his tiny feet, until these cruel
boys had again loaded their gun. Then Henry
took a truer aim, and brought him to the
ground. But he was not dead. Henry seized
the trembling creature, that tried in vain to
escape, and held him fast in his hands.</p>

<p>“Wring off his neck,” said Alfred; “that’s
the way.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” returned Henry; “I’ll take him
home just as he is: perhaps he’ll get well, and
then I’ll put him in a cage, and keep him.”</p>

<p>And so Henry kept the bird, that must have
been suffering great pain, carefully in his hand,
while Alfred loaded his gun once more. But
we will not follow these boys further in their
cruel employment, which was continued for
several hours, when they grew tired, and returned
home. It was past the dinner hour
when Henry got back, with four birds for his
share of the morning’s sport. One of these was
the oriole, still alive. Another was a sparrow,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
another a robin, and the fourth a blue-bird.
These last three were all dead.</p>

<p>“Just see, mother, what I’ve got; and I
killed them all myself,” cried Henry, as he came
in and displayed his birds. “Won’t you ask
father to buy me a gun? Alfred Lyon has got
one, and I think I ought to have one too. I
asked father to-day to buy me one, but he said
<i>No</i>. Won’t you ask him to buy me a gun,
mother? for I can shoot; I shot all these with
Alfred’s gun, myself.”</p>

<p>Henry’s mother listened to her son with surprise
and pain. “Poor bird!” said she, taking
from Henry the wounded oriole, and handling
it with great tenderness. “Can it be possible
that my son has done this?—that his hand
has committed so cruel a deed?” and the tears
dimmed her eyes.</p>

<p>The words, tone, and manner of his mother
touched the heart of Henry in an instant.
New thoughts were awakened, and with these
thoughts came new feelings. His mind had a
glimpse of the truth, that it was wrong to sport
with the life of any creature.</p>

<p>“Can you make a pretty bird like this?” his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
mother asked, pointing to the drooping bird in
her hand. Her son was silent.</p>

<p>“Then why seek, wantonly, to take its life?”
she continued. “Were you envious of its happiness?
Like an evil spirit, did a sight of innocent
delights inflame you with a desire to destroy
it? Can you restore health to its wounded
body? No! Can you ever assuage its present
agonies? No—you cannot. Cruel boy! what
could you have been dreaming about? Think,
how terrible it would be, if there were a race
of beings stronger than we are, who, with the
power, had the will to destroy us for mere
sport. Some day I might be walking out, and
become the victim of one of these, and then my
children would have no mother. Perhaps
Henry might leave me, and while on his way
to school might be shot at, as he shot at the
birds, and be killed like this pretty blue-bird,
or fatally wounded like this oriole. Would
you think such sport innocent? I think not.
Poor bird! See how it trembles! See how it
flutters its wings in pain! See how it gasps!
Now it has fallen over upon its side—and now
it is dead! Alas, that my son should have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
done this cruel deed—that my son should have
caused all this pain!”</p>

<p>The words of Henry’s mother touched him
deeply. They caused him to see how cruel he
had indeed been. They made him conscious
that it was most wicked to hurt or kill any
one of God’s creatures in mere sport. So
moved was he, that he could not refrain from
bursting into tears and sobbing bitterly.</p>

<p>“O mother!” he said, after he had gained
some little command over his feelings, “I never
thought how wicked and cruel it was to take
pleasure in hunting the pretty birds. I don’t
want a gun. I wouldn’t have a gun now, if
father would buy me the handsomest one in
town.”</p>

<p>Henry’s mother was glad to hear him say
this, for it showed that he felt all she wished
him to feel—sorrow at having indulged in a
cruel sport. It showed, also, that he had determined
in his own mind, from seeing how
wicked it was, never to do so again. From
this determination Henry never swerved. He
was never known afterwards to hurt any
animal in sport. And more than this, by talking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
to his little friend Alfred, he caused him to
see how wrong it was to shoot the birds; and
Alfred gave his gun back to his father, who
sold it for him, and with the money bought
him a number of good and useful books.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“HOW are you going to spend your holiday?”
asked Edgar Williams of Charles
Manly.</p>

<p>“I don’t know; how are you going
to spend yours?”</p>

<p>“I’m going a-fishing; won’t you go with
me?”</p>

<p>“No, I think not,” replied Manly.</p>

<p>“Why? It will be fine sport.”</p>

<p>But Manly shook his head, and replied,—</p>

<p>“I don’t think it such fine sport to hunt
the little fishes. I’m sure I shouldn’t like a
sharp hook in my mouth. Ugh! To think
of being lifted up by a hook fastened in your
tongue, or in the roof of your mouth!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>“You’re very tender-hearted all at once,”
replied Edgar Williams. “I’ve seen you fishing,
many a time.”</p>

<p>“No doubt of it. But I hardly think I
shall go again. Father says it is cruel sport;
and so it is. Suppose you don’t go, Edgar.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, but I will. It’s delightful. I’m
fond of it above everything.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what I should like to do, if
you would go with me,” said Charles Manly.</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“I should like to go out into the woods and
fields, to look for specimens for my cabinet.”</p>

<p>“A fig for specimens!” returned Williams.
“No, indeed! I’m going a-fishing.”</p>

<p>The two lads had each some money given
to him by his parents to spend. With
his money, Edgar Williams bought a fishing-line,
a rod, and some bait; and taking his
dinner in a basket, started off alone to spend
his day in fishing from the river-bank. During
the morning the fish would not bite.
Hour after hour he threw his line in vain. He
did not get so much as a nibble. About mid-day,
tired and disappointed, Edgar threw his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
rod upon the grass, and now beginning to feel
hungry, he opened his lunch-basket and took
therefrom his dinner, the eating of which he
enjoyed much more than he had enjoyed his
fishing. After this, he lay down under the
shade of a tree and slept for an hour. When
he awoke, he felt dull and heavy, and wished
himself at home. But he had caught nothing,
and did not want to go back with so poor an
account of his doings. So he took up his rod
and line, and again sought to take the life, for
mere sport, of some fish, tempted, in the hope
of obtaining food, to seize upon the murderous
hook. But his red cork lay, as before, immovable
upon the smooth surface of the river
for a very long time. At last it suddenly disappeared,
and Edgar gave his line a quick jerk,
which brought up a bright little sunfish, that
had hoped to get a good dinner, but was, alas!
sadly disappointed. It was not more than
three inches long, and beautiful to look upon as
a fish could be, so thin, so delicately made,
and so purely golden in its hue. Edgar caught
the fluttering little creature in his hand, and
tore the cruel hook from its bleeding mouth.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
Just at that moment he thought of what Charles
Manly had said, about having a sharp hook in
his tongue or tearing into the roof of his mouth,
and for the first time in his life he felt pity for
a fish. The quivering little animal was still
in his hand, and he held it up and looked at
its torn mouth, with the blood oozing therefrom,
and sorrow for the pain he had occasioned
touched his heart.</p>

<p>“It is cruel sport, as Charles said, sure
enough,” he murmured to himself. “This little
fish never did me any harm. And even if I
were in want of food, which I am not, it is too
small to eat. So I have no excuse for doing it
this sad injury. Go, little fish!” he added, throwing
it back again into the river. “I will not rob
you of life, though I have seriously injured you.”</p>

<p>But the fish, instead of diving down out of
sight into the deep water, turned upon its side
and swam about unevenly upon the surface of the
water. Edgar felt grieved when he saw this.</p>

<p>“Poor little sunfish,” he said; “I hope you
will not die.”</p>

<p>Just then he observed a sudden rippling
motion of the water, a short distance from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
where the sunfish was swimming about, and in
an instant afterwards the little sufferer was
seized by some larger fish and devoured.</p>

<p>“I’ll never fish again for sport!” said Edgar,
throwing his rod and line into the water, and
turning sadly away from the river-side.</p>

<p>It was nearly night when he arrived at
home, tired and altogether dissatisfied with himself.
More than an hour elapsed after he went
to bed before he could close his eyes in sleep.
The image of that beautiful little sunfish, with
its torn and bleeding mouth, was too vividly
present to his mind. During the night, he
dreamed that he fell into the river, and was
seized by some monster, as he had seen the sunfish
seized. He awoke in terror, with the perspiration
starting from every pore, and it was
a long time before sleep visited his eyes again.</p>

<p>Sweeter far, and more peaceful, were the
dreams of Charles Manly, who had gone with
his sister to the museum, and spent his holiday
there, examining the many curious and wonderful
things in art and nature that it contained.
His enjoyment had been innocent, and it had
left his mind tranquil and peaceful.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="antiqua">Rover and his Little Master.</span></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/image104b.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“COME, Rover!” said Harry, as he passed
a fine old Newfoundland dog that lay
on a mat at the door; “come, Rover! I
am going down to the river to sail my
boat, and I want you to go with me.”</p>

<p>Rover opened his large eyes, and looked
lazily at his little master.</p>

<p>“Come, Rover!—Rover!”</p>

<p>But the dog didn’t care to move, and so
Harry went off to the river-side alone. He
had not been gone a great while, before a
thought of her boy came suddenly into the
mother’s mind. Remembering that he had a
little vessel, and that the river was near, it
occurred to her that he might have gone there.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>Instantly her heart began to throb with
alarm.</p>

<p>“Is Harry with you?” she called up to
Harry’s father, who was in his study. But
Harry’s father said he was not there.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid he’s gone to the river with his
boat,” said the mother.</p>

<p>“To the river!” And Mr. Lee dropped his
pen, and came quickly down. Taking up his
hat, he went hurriedly from the house. Rover
was still lying upon the mat, with his head
upon his paws and his eyes shut.</p>

<p>“Rover!” said his master, in a quick, excited
voice, “where is Harry? Has he gone to the
river? Away and see! quick!”</p>

<p>The dog must have understood every word,
for he sprang eagerly to his feet, and rushed
toward the river. Mr. Lee followed as fast as
he could run. When he reached the river-bank,
he saw his little boy in the water, with
Rover dragging him towards the shore. He
was just in time to receive the half-drowned
child in his arms, and carry him home to his
mother.</p>

<p>Harry, who remained insensible, was placed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
in a warm bed. He soon, however, revived,
and in an hour or two was running about again.
But after this, Rover would never leave the
side of his little master, when he wandered
beyond the garden gate. Wherever you found
Harry, there Rover was sure to be—sometimes
walking by his side, and sometimes lying on
the grass, with his big eyes watching every
movement.</p>

<p>Once Harry found his little vessel, which
had been hidden away since he went with it
to the river, and, without his mother seeing
him, he started again for the water. Rover,
as usual, was with him. On his way to the
river he saw some flowers, and, in order to
gather them, put his boat down upon the grass.
Instantly Rover picked it up in his mouth, and
walked back towards the house with it. After
going a little way, he stopped, looked round,
and waited until Harry had got his hand full
of flowers. The child then saw that Rover
had his boat, and tried to get it from him; but
Rover played round him, always keeping out
of his reach, and retreating towards the house,
until he got back within the gate. Then he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
bounded into the house, and laid the boat at
the feet of Harry’s mother.</p>

<p>Harry was a little angry with the good old
dog, at first; but when his mother explained to
him what Rover meant, he hugged him round
the neck, and said he would never go down to
the river any more.</p>

<p>Harry is a man now, and Rover has long
since been dead; but he often thinks of the
dear old dog that saved him from drowning
when he was a child; and it gives him great
pleasure to remember that he never beat Rover,
as some boys beat their dogs, when they are
angry, and was never unkind to him. Had it
been otherwise, the thought would have given
him great pain.</p>

<span class="small">OR, “TWO WRONGS NEVER MAKE A RIGHT.”</span></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/image108b.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A MOTHER, who loved her children
very much, sat reading a good book
one day, while her two little boys
were playing in the next room.
All at once loud cries and angry
words fell upon her ears, and gave
her great pain. She rose up quickly, and
went in to the children, and there she saw a
sad sight indeed. James, her eldest boy, whose
eighth birthday had just been passed, was
standing over his younger brother, Henry, with
his hand raised, and his face red with anger;
and Henry had doubled his little fist, and was
ready to strike again.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>“James! Henry!” cried their mother, as
soon as her eyes fell upon them.</p>

<p>“Mother! mother! Henry knocked over
my house, and he did it on purpose,” said the
eldest boy, a blush of shame covering his face,
and hiding the red anger that was on it an
instant before.</p>

<p>“No, mother, I didn’t do it on purpose,”
spoke up little Henry. “It was an accident;
and he struck me.”</p>

<p>“And then what did you do?” asked the
mother, taking the little boy by the hand, and
looking him in the face.</p>

<p>Henry held down his head, and replied, “I
struck him again.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how wrong that was!”</p>

<p>“But I didn’t mean to knock over his house.”</p>

<p>“How was it, James?” the mother asked,
appealing to the eldest boy.</p>

<p>“He did knock over my house.”</p>

<p>“But, do you believe it was done on purpose?”</p>

<p>“He kept pushing his foot against it all the
while, and I told him not to do it,” said James.</p>

<p>“Why, Henry?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>Henry again hung down his head, and was
silent.</p>

<p>“And so you did it on purpose, Henry?”</p>

<p>“Oh no, no, mother, I didn’t do it on purpose,”
cried Henry, bursting into tears and
burying his face in his mother’s lap. “It was
an accident. I did put my foot against the
house, <i>just to plague him</i>; but I didn’t mean
to push it over. <i>Something made my foot go
hard against it.</i> But I am sorry.”</p>

<p>And Henry sobbed aloud.</p>

<p>“Henry is sorry for what he has done,
James; he did not do it on purpose. But
you were angry and struck him on purpose.
Are you not sorry?”</p>

<p>“But he was trying to plague me; and he
is always trying to plague me.”</p>

<p>“That was wrong, James. But, you know
that I have often said to you—<i>two wrongs
never make a right</i>. Do you feel any happier
now, because you struck your brother?”</p>

<p>James was silent.</p>

<p>“Tell me, my son, do you think you are
happier for what you have done?”</p>

<p>The little boy said, “No.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>“But you feel very unhappy?”</p>

<p>“Yes, mother.”</p>

<p>“That is a sign that you have done wrong.
When we do right it makes us happy. Are
you not always sorry after you have done
wrong?”</p>

<p>“Yes, mother.”</p>

<p>“You are sorry that you struck Henry?”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“And Henry is sorry for having tried to
plague you; ain’t you, Henry?”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“Then give James your hand, my son. He
is sorry for having struck you.”</p>

<p>The little boys took hold of each other’s
hands, and looked into each other’s faces. But
tears were in both their eyes, and on their
cheeks.</p>

<p>“Now kiss each other with the kiss of forgiveness.”</p>

<p>The children put their arms round each
other’s necks, and kissed each other with a
warm kiss of love and forgiveness.</p>

<p>“Now bring me that little book lying on
the table, James,” said the mother.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>James brought the book, and the mother
opened it, and read:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">“‘Whatever brawls disturb the street,</div>
<div class="indent">There should be peace at home;</div>
<div class="verse">Where sisters dwell, and brothers meet,</div>
<div class="indent">Quarrels should never come.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">“‘Birds in their little nests agree,</div>
<div class="indent">And ’tis a shameful sight,</div>
<div class="verse">When children of one family</div>
<div class="indent">Fall out, and chide, and fight.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">“‘Hard names at first, and angry words,</div>
<div class="indent">Which are but noisy breath,</div>
<div class="verse">May come to clubs and naked swords,</div>
<div class="indent">To murder and to death.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>“Think of that, my dear children! ‘To murder
and to death!’ If you quarrel with each
other now, instead of growing up and loving
each other, you may grow up to hate each
other. I remember two brothers that were
once no older than you are. They were
always quarrelling with each other, and they
kept on quarrelling as they grew up. One
day, after they had become men, they got into
a dispute about something, when one of them
struck the other a dreadful blow with a stick
and killed him. Was not that a terrible
thing? And who knows but that you, if you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
keep on quarrelling as you do now, may grow
up to hate one another.”</p>

<p>“Henry, do you know why it is that you
so often try to tease your brother James?”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“Why is it, my son?”</p>

<p>“I let evil spirits come into me, and do
what they wish me to do.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is the reason. But can’t you
keep them out.”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am, if I try.”</p>

<p>“Do you like to have evil spirits in you,
instead of good angels.”</p>

<p>“Oh no. I love the good angels, and I hate
the wicked spirits that make me do wrong.”</p>

<p>“How can you keep the wicked spirits out?”</p>

<p>“By not doing the wrong things they want
me to do, and then the good angels will drive
them all away.”</p>

<p>“I hope, my dear children, as you know so
well what is right, that you will never again
let wicked spirits from hell have anything to
do with you. When they again tempt you to
plague your brother, Henry, you must not do it,
and then they will go away; and you, James,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
if Henry should again be so weak and foolish
as to let the evil spirits come into him, must
not let them come into you at the same time.
If, instead of letting them tempt you to
strike him, you permit the good angels to
govern you, you will speak kindly to him, and
say, ‘Don’t, brother, please.’ I am sure he
will do so no longer. By doing this, you will
help him to cast out the evil spirits who are
seeking to destroy him.”</p>

<p>“How destroy him, mother?”</p>

<p>“All evil spirits seek to destroy children by
making them wicked like themselves, so that
they may be cast into hell. They hate
children so much, that, if they were not restrained
by the Lord, they would do them all
manner of harm—would utterly destroy them;
for they burn with hatred towards little children.”</p>

<p>“But the Lord won’t let them hurt us.”</p>

<p>“Not if we will keep them out of our hearts.
But if we let them come in, he cannot save us.
And, whenever you are angry with each other,
they come into your little hearts. Oh! my
dear children, keep out these dreadful enemies,
or they will utterly destroy you.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>The children burst into tears, kissed each
other and their mother again and again, and
promised that they would try and never speak
or act unkindly to one another as long as they
lived. We hope they will not; and that all
our little readers will try, like them, to keep
evil spirits far away, that good angels may be
round about them and dwell in their young
hearts.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="antiqua">The Use of Flowers.</span></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/image116b.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“JUST one moment longer, cousin Mary;
I want to put this flower in your
hair. Now doesn’t it look sweet,
sister Aggy?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes! very sweet. And here
is the dearest little bud I ever saw. I took it
from the sweet-brier bush in the lane. Put
that, too, in cousin Mary’s hair.”</p>

<p>Little Florence, seeing what was going on,
was soon also at work upon Mary’s hair, which,
in a little while, was covered with buds and
blossoms.</p>

<p>“Now she is our May Queen,” said the children,
as they hung fondly around their cousin,
who had come into the country to enjoy a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
weeks of rural quiet, in the season of fruits and
flowers.</p>

<p>“And our May Queen must sing us a song,”
said Agnes, who was sitting at the feet of her
cousin. “Sing us something about flowers.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes!” spoke up Grace; “sing us that
beautiful piece by Mrs. Howitt, about the use of
flowers. You sang it for us, you remember, the
last time you were here.”</p>

<p>Cousin Mary sang as desired. After she had
concluded, she said,—</p>

<p>“Flowers, according to these beautiful verses,
are only useful as objects to delight our senses.
They are only beautiful forms in nature—their
highest use, their beauty and fragrance.”</p>

<p>“I think that is what Mrs. Howitt means,”
replied Grace. “So I have always understood
her. And I cannot see any other use that
flowers have. Do you know of any other use,
cousin?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes. Flowers have a more important
use than merely giving delight to the senses.
Without them, plants could not produce fruit
and seed. You notice that the flower always
comes before the fruit?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>“Oh yes. But why is a flower needed?
Why does not the fruit push itself directly out
from the stem of a plant?” asked Agnes.</p>

<p>“Flowers are the most exquisitely delicate
in their texture of all forms in the vegetable
kingdom. Look at the petals of this one.
Could anything be softer or finer? The leaf,
the bark, and the wood of the plant are all
coarse, in comparison to the flower. Now, as
nothing is made in vain, there must be some
reason for this. The leaves and bark, as well
as wood, of plants, all have vessels through
which sap flows, and this sap nourishes, sustains,
and builds up the plant, as our blood
does our bodies. But the whole effort of the
plant is to reproduce itself; and to this end it
forms seed, which, when cast into the ground,
takes root, springs up, and makes a new plant.
To form this seed requires the purest juices of
the plant, and these are obtained by means of
the flowers, through the exquisitely fine vessels
of which these juices are filtered, or strained,
and thus separated from all that is gross and
impure.”</p>

<p>“I never thought of that before,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
Agnes. “Flowers, then, are useful as well as
beautiful.”</p>

<p>“Nothing is made for mere beauty. All
things in nature regard use as an end. To
flowers are assigned a high and important use,
and exquisite beauty of form and colour is at
the same time given to them; and with these
our senses are delighted. They are, in more
respects than one, good gifts from our heavenly
Father.”</p>

<p>“Oh! how I do love the flowers,” said
Agnes; “and now, when I look upon them,
and think of their use as well as their beauty,
I shall love them still more. Are they so very
beautiful because their use is such an important
one, cousin Mary?”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear; I believe this is so. In the
seeds of plants there is an image of the infinity
of our great Creator; for in seeds resides a
power, or an effort, to reproduce the plants, that
lie concealed as gems within them, to infinity.
We might naturally enough suppose that flowers,
whose use it is to refine and prepare the juices
of plants, so as to free them from all grosser
matters, and make them fit for the important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
office of developing and maturing seeds, would
be exceedingly delicate in their structure, and,
as a natural consequence, beautiful to look upon.
And we will believe, therefore, that their peculiar
beauty depends upon their peculiar use.”</p>
